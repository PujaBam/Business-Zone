            <h2>Open a new company in Dubai: Step-by-step guide</h2>
            <p>
              When looking for a country in which to start a business, the UAE –
              and particularly Dubai – is often near the top of the list.
            </p>

            <p>
              The emirate is famed for its minimal bureaucracy, its key global
              position and, of course, its incredibly attractive tax rate –
              still at 0% on both personal and corporate incomes.
            </p>

            <p>
              Many are also attracted by just how easy it is to start a new
              business in Dubai, regardless of how familiar you are with the UAE
              and its corporate practices.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you’re looking to open a business in Dubai, the first step is
              to talk to company setup agent who can guide you through your
              license and visa applications. In the meantime, here’s a simple
              step-by-step guide to help you get familiar with the process.

            <h2>Should you choose mainland or free zone?</h2>
            <p>
              The first important decision to make before you get underway with
              the application and incorporation process is deciding on the
              mainland or a free zone.
            </p>

            <p>
              The mainland offers advantages such as the ability to trade
              directly with the local market without using the services of an
              agent as well as the ability to set up anywhere in the UAE.
            </p>

            <p>
              In most cases, however, free zone company formation is the most
              cost-effective and advantageous approach.
            </p>

            <p>
              Dubai is home to many free zones offering affordable license
              packages and fast company setup options. Outside of Dubai, you
              will find many more. Free zones such as Fujairah Creative City,
              for example, offer benefits including a quick and easy
              incorporation process, ongoing business support and financial
              incentives such as tax exemptions and zero currency restrictions.
            </p>

            <p>
              In either case, it’s a good idea to start your business with the
              help of a company setup expert to ensure a fast and smooth
              process.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you are looking to get your company license in Dubai, Dubai
              free zone visa, or the cheapest free zone license or visa in the

            <h2>How to open a company in Dubai</h2>
            <p>
              Starting a company in Dubai can be a very straightforward process
              providing you seek out and follow the right advice.
            </p>
            <p>
              When managed correctly, it is possible to open a business in Dubai
              in just four simple steps.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Selecting your business activities</strong>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              The first thing to do when starting a company in Dubai is to
              decide on your business activities. The important thing here is
              that your chosen activities are in line with those on the official
              Department of Economic Development (DED) list. Chances are, they
              will be – the list covers every industry imaginable, from potato
              trading to consultancy.
            </p>
            <ol start="2">
              <li>
                <strong>Choosing your company name</strong>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Then comes another hugely important step: choosing a company name.
              There are a few key things to keep in mind at this stage – many
              that would not apply to anywhere else in the world.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              Be aware that you must abide by a strict set of naming
              conventions. In short, you should avoid any offensive or
              blasphemous language. Avoid names of well-known organisations and
              avoid abbreviations if naming your company after yourself – i.e.
              Dave Mann Consulting, rather than D Mann Consulting. You must also
              check that your chosen name is available to register.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <ol start="3">
              <li>
                <strong>Making your license application</strong>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              With the formalities out of the way, we come to the most important
              step of all – applying for your trade license.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are several license types to choose from. If your business
              activities fall into the category of industrial or manufacturing,
              then you will require an industrial license. If you are in the
              commercial sector – i.e. the buying and selling of goods – then
              you will require a commercial license.
            </p>
            <p>
              Similarly, those offering professional services will require a
              professional license. Whether applying to form a company in the
              mainland or in a free zone, you are usually only required to
              provide a few details and some basic documentation, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <img

                />
                Completed application form
              </li>
              <li>
                <img
                  src="https://www.businessincorporationzone.ae/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/list-icon.svg"
                />Passport copy of the proposed owner or onwers
              </li>
              <li>
                <img
                  src="https://www.businessincorporationzone.ae/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/list-icon.svg"
                />Two color Passport size
              </li>
            </ul>

              <li>
                <strong>Making your visa applications</strong><br />
                "You’ll also need a visa to work in the UAE – as will your
                employees should you<br />
                have any."
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Again, with the right guidance, the visa application process can
              be incredibly straightforward. Most company formation agents can
              help you with this step as well as with your license application.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the holder of a UAE business license, you can also sponsor
              others for their visas too. This could be a spouse, parent or
              child, or a domestic worker such as a housekeeper.
            </p>
            <p>
              The maximum number of visas you can apply for will depend on the
              size of your company, your chosen setup and, for dependant visas,
              your personal earnings.

            <h2>What is the cost of starting a new business in Dubai?</h2>
            <p>
              The total cost of starting a new business in Dubai will depend on
              a range of factors including whether you start a mainland or free
              zone company and the size of your organisation.
            </p>

            <p>
              As a starting guide, it is possible to obtain a free zone license,
              inclusive of the use of co-working facilities and the cost of a
              visa application for around AED 25,000.
            </p>

            <p>
              Should you opt for the mainland, require additional visas or the
              use of a large premises then you can expect this number to
              increase.
            </p>
          </div>

            <h2>Are you ready to start a new business in Dubai?</h2>
            <p>
              Hopefully this guide has made it clear that if you’re armed with
              the right knowledge, setting up a business in Dubai doesn’t have
              to be overly complex.
            </p>

            <p>
              That being said, it does require a level of prior knowledge of the
              process. What’s more, it is important to note that the application
              process is only straightforward if your license application is
              complete at the time of submission and free from errors.
            </p>

            <p>
              To help you to ensure that this is the case, it’s a good idea to
              work with a company formation specialist such as Business
              Incorporation Zone (BIZ) when establishing a new company in the
              UAE.
