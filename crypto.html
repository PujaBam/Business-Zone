            <p>
              Crypto is a hot buzzword in the UAE. The country is really leading
              the way with popularizing crypto-friendly conversations, making it
              as open to cryptocurrency adoption as anywhere in the world. This
              is particularly true from a legislative perspective, with moves
              made by the UAE government to promote the use of blockchain
              technologies and cryptocurrencies in business settings.
            </p>

            <p>
              Now, not everybody is sold on the idea of cryptocurrency, which is
              understandable. There are many narratives surrounding crypto that
              can easily turn people away: “it will replace money”, “fiat
              currencies are fading”, etc. All the while, Bitcoin’s value
              remains volatile, and it almost feels like the industry is trying
              to run before it can walk.
            </p>

            <p>
              Nonetheless, it is as feasible an investment opportunity, in my
              opinion, as any other long term staking. There is of course a
              balance between risk and reward that is aligned to your own
              personal circumstances, but look in the right places – and
              importantly, invest in the right exchanges – and this can open up
              a world of opportunity.

            <h5><strong>My Favorite Crypto Exchanges</strong></h5>
            <p>
              A crypto exchange is a cryptocurrency marketplace. Exchanges act
              as ledgers to facilitate the buying and selling of crypto, so if
              you want to buy crypto, head to an exchange!
            </p>

            <p>
              There are hundreds of exchanges to choose from across the world.
              Some are global exchanges, others specialise in specific
              currencies, and a few even focus solely on a specific set of
              cryptocurrencies. Regardless of this, if you’re on the search for
              a cryptocurrency exchange to invest in, I’d stick to the top 20
              ranked.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h5><strong>These are my top 3 crypto exchanges:</strong></h5>
            <p>
              <strong>Binance – </strong>Binance is the GOAT of crypto
              exchanges. They have huge trading volumes on a daily basis of over
              $15 billion, and a presence in the market that is felt the world
              over.
            </p>

            <p>
              I would say that Binance is actually as close to a financial
              institution as you will find in cryptocurrency. Binance Pay, a
              means of sending cryptocurrency to friends and family as well as
              buying goods in crypto, is the very first of its kind in the
              industry.
            </p>

            <p>
              Khaby Lame was announced in June as a brand ambassador too, which
              goes to show that they’re looking in the right places to build
              their reputation, and have a clear understanding of who their
              audience is.
            </p>

            <p>
              The CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao, is himself Dubai based. He has
              noted the city’s openness to the adoption of cryptocurrencies as a
              huge opportunity for the exchange, and they now have a trading
              license to operate in the region. This allows traders in the
              region to feel like they’re close to the exchange, and it is by no
              means a faceless organization in that sense.
            </p>

            <p>
              Traders can purchase crypto using AED, as well as the usual
              options of USD, GBP and more.
            </p>

            <p>
              For a well-oiled, polished exchange with a stellar reputation and
              a solid presence in the GCC, it’s hard to look beyond Binance.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Coinbase –</strong> Coinbase is essentially the second in
              command in the crypto industry. With a 24 hour trading volume
              averaging close to $2.5 billion, they may be well behind Binance –
              but they’re streets ahead of the rest.
            </p>

            <p>
              A key selling point in favor of Coinbase is that they are NASDAQ
              listed, and actively collaborate with government agencies in the
              United States to develop software for their administrations. As
              far as clout is concerned, Coinbase has plenty of it.
            </p>

            <p>
              It is worth noting that Coinbase only accepts three major
              currencies – the US Dollar, Pound Sterling, and the Euro. However,
              with the Dirham pegged to the Dollar, that shouldn’t have too much
              of an impact on local traders who want an exchange with a solid
              foundation.
            </p>

            <p>
              To that end, with Pound Sterling underperforming over recent
              months, traders in the UAE may even get a bit more for their money
              if they were to trade in GBP.
            </p>

            <p>
              You may also remember the famous QR code advert from the 2022
              Super Bowl? That was Coinbase. Nice job, team.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>BitOasis – </strong>This is a personal favorite of mine,
              for biased reasons. Led by the incredible Ola Doudin, Coinbase is
              the MENA region’s largest dedicated cryptocurrency exchange.
            </p>

            <p>
              So, not only are Bitoasis led by a groundbreaking female
              entrepreneur, they’re tailored to be adapted just for the traders
              of our region.
            </p>

            <p>
              Crypto is a growth market in MENA, with once flawed perceptions
              slowly turning thanks to the hard work of the BitOasis team to
              build a positive reputation for both cryptocurrencies and
              exchanges in general.
            </p>

            <p>
              Both the desktop and app versions of the exchange have a really
              smooth interface, making them super easy to navigate, and there
              are very strong verification measurements in place on the platform
              to ensure that every user who trades on the platform is verified.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you want to be part of a MENA-led crypto revolution, jump
              aboard with BitOasis.

              <strong>What To Look For From An Exchange</strong>
            </h3>
            <p>
              As I mentioned previously, there are so many different exchanges
              to choose from when trading crypto. The amount of choice can prove
              to be overwhelming, so it’s important to filter down and hold
              exchanges to a high standard to earn your custom.
            </p>
            <h4>Here are three things I consider when choosing an exchange:</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Reputation.</strong> Use CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko to
              judge this, as well as word of mouth and general social media
              presence overall. CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko are to crypto
              exchanges what comparison websites are to regular businesses, so
              you can head to them if you want to judge the rep of an exchange.
            </p>

            <p>
              CoinMarketCap also gives an Exchange Score to every exchange they
              list. If they’re not above 6.5, I recommend staying clear.
            </p>

            <p>
              Do note, there are plenty of good exchanges that aren’t listed –
              BitOasis being a perfect example of this. There are of course many
              other factors to consider, but this is a pretty good indicator to
              begin with.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Trading Volume. </strong>Trading volume is something you
              can see on CoinMarketCap and Coin Gecko too. Next to each listed
              exchange, their trading volume over the previous 24 hours will
              also be visible.
            </p>

            <p>
              Now, there’s a little bit of an art to this, because it’s not as
              simple as looking for the exchanges with the highest volume. You
              can of course keep it simple with the top rated exchanges, notably
              Binance and Coinbase. However, if you’re looking a little further
              down the chain of exchanges, you want to look for a trading volume
              that looks realistic, rather than large.
            </p>

            <p>
              The fact of the matter is that trading volume reporting can easily
              be manipulated. So, look for what feels right – it’s most likely a
              sign of transparency.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong> Transparency.</strong> That’s the final thing I look for
              from an exchange, and it’s a very very simple method I use to
              gauge whether it’s there. If I google the name of the exchange,
              followed by CEO, and I can’t find the name of the CEO within 3
              articles? Move on.
            </p>

            <p>
              The crypto industry is still building a reputation for itself.
              Exchanges that take the opportunity to build credibility and trust
              in their user base should be prioritized.
            </p>

            <p>
              What’s more, the less you know about an exchange, the more likely
              they are to not be forthcoming about how they do business. Or
              certainly, the more you know about an exchange, the more
              confidence can be built into their operations.
            </p>

            <p>
              The nature of cryptocurrencies being faceless means there is a
              vacancy for business owners to fill that faceless void. Look for
              exchanges that voluntarily fill it.
            </p>

              You’re in the right region if you’re a crypto enthusiast. That,
              however, doesn’t mean that normal rules don’t apply when it comes
              to finding the right exchange. It’s important to do your research
              in full when selecting the right crypto exchange to invest in
              cryptocurrencies with.
            </p>

              Follow the steps I follow, and you’ll find the right exchange for
              you.
            </p>

            <p>
              Remember – cryptocurrency investment holds risk. Please research
              projects in full before investing.
